## Skills (mandatory)
Before replying, scan the skills below. If a skill matches or is even partially relevant to your task, you MUST load it with skill_view(name) and follow its instructions. Err on the side of loading — it is always better to have context you don't need than to miss critical steps, pitfalls, or established workflows. Skills contain specialized knowledge — API endpoints, tool-specific commands, and proven workflows that outperform general-purpose approaches. Load the skill even if you think you could handle the task with basic tools like web_search or terminal. Skills also encode the user's preferred approach, conventions, and quality standards for tasks like code review, planning, and testing — load them even for tasks you already know how to do, because the skill defines how it should be done here.
Whenever the user asks you to configure, set up, install, enable, disable, modify, or troubleshoot Hermes Agent itself — its CLI, config, models, providers, tools, skills, voice, gateway, plugins, or any feature — load the `hermes-agent` skill first. It has the actual commands (e.g. `hermes config set …`, `hermes tools`, `hermes setup`) so you don't have to guess or invent workarounds.
If a skill has issues, fix it with skill_manage(action='patch').
After difficult/iterative tasks, offer to save as a skill. If a skill you loaded was missing steps, had wrong commands, or needed pitfalls you discovered, update it before finishing.
